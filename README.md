# DockAndSort
Technical Portion of oSiRIS Interview

The scripts here pull the base centos7 image from DockerHub, runs the openshift/base-centos7 container, and pulls shell information from
the provided website and sorts it by the fourth row. After that, it counts how many entries in each shell there were, and prints that
information (and the sorted list) to the file "sorted-file.txt".

To run the file, open DockAndSort.ps1, and run it. The rest should take care of itself! Output is again in sorted-file.txt
